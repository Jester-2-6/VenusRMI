### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Create production build
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run type-check` - Run TypeScript type checking

### Testing

npm run lint
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. The pipeline includes:

### Continuous Integration
- Runs on every push to main and pull requests
- Executes tests and linting
- Ensures code quality before merging

### Continuous Deployment
- Automatically creates releases when tags are pushed to main
- Builds and packages the application for:
  - Windows (.exe)
  - macOS (.dmg)
  - Linux (.AppImage, .deb, .rpm)

### Release Process

1. Create a new tag:
```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

2. The release workflow will automatically:
   - Build the application for all platforms
   - Create a GitHub release
   - Upload the built packages

## Contributing

2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request
   - Use the provided pull request template
